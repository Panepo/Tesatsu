John's Epic GSL Season 2 Finals Speech
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSZWSG2eH3M

From PTT StarCraft 看板
English: xephon
Translate: Panepo


I'm gonna be talking my own things now as there isn't anything important to translate.

我現在要來講些我自己的事因為現在沒甚麼重要的需要翻譯.
(ps. 說這些話的是個翻譯)

First of all I'd like to say I have a great respect for NesTea not just because he won the tournament but because this guy had the courage to do what he wanted to do and proved he was right.

首先我要說我非常尊敬 NesTea, 不僅僅是他贏得這次比賽, 而且他有勇氣去做他想做的並證明他是對的.
(ps. NesTea 29 歲, 這年紀對電競選手來說非常的大, 10年努力最終於29歲奪冠.)

I'm saying this because too many people even in Korea consider playing games is a waste of time. I, myself, was unemployed for 2 years, but a year and a half before I joined GOM. All I did was play games at home and my friends would say that I'm wasting my life. Well...who's laughing now? I asked them "Can you honestly say that you like your job?" and I asked them "Do you have a fan who draws a fan-art just for you?" That shuts them up.

我說這些是因為很多人, 甚至在韓國, 認為玩遊戲是浪費時間. 我呢, 曾經失業兩年, 然後再一年半前我加入 GOM. 這段時間我所做的事就是在家玩遊戲, 而我的朋友說我在浪費人生. 如今, 是誰笑了? 我問他們 "你們能成心說出你熱愛你的工作嗎?" 我接著問 "你們能有 fan 特地為你畫了張圖(fan-art)嗎?" 這都讓他們閉嘴了.
(ps. GOM: 這次負責轉播的電視台)

So everytime you feel ashamed of being a nerd and your friends, teachers, neighbours and even parents think gaming is a waste of time you'll remember; There's no such thing as wasting life as long as you have the courage to do what you like and be passionate about it. You'll remember, if NesTea listened to all those critics he wouldn't be standing there with a trophy and you'll remember that even if you feel nobody around you supports you that I, Jay, Artosis and Tasteless, everyone in GOM will support you.

所以每當你羞愧作為一個宅, 並且被你的朋友, 老師, 鄰居甚至家人說玩遊戲是浪費時間時你要記住: 世上沒有事情是浪費生命, 只要你有勇氣去做你熱愛的事. 請你記得, NesTea 要是聽了那些閒言閒語, 他將不會拿這冠軍獎盃站在這. 請你記得, 即使你認為周遭的人都不支持你時, 我, Jay, Artosis, Tasteless 和 GOM 所有人都會支持你.

Why? Because we believe in esports.

為什麼? 因為我們相信 esports
