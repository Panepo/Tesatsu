How to delete large files super fast in god damn win10?

1. delete all files
```
DEL /F/Q/S *.* > NUL
```
- /F -- forces the deletion of read-only files.
- /Q -- enables quiet mode. You are not ask if it is ok to delete files (if you don't use this, you are asked for any file in the folder).
- /S -- runs the command on all files in any folder under the selected structure.
- *.* -- delete all files.
- NUL -- disables console output. This improves the process further, shaving off about one quarter of the processing time off of the console command.

2. delete all folders
```
RMDIR /Q/S foldername
```
- /Q -- Quiet mode, won't prompt for confirmation to delete folders.
- /S -- Run the operation on all folders of the selected path.
- foldername -- The absolute path or relative folder name, e.g. o:/backup/test1 or test1
